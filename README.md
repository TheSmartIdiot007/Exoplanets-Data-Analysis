# Exoplanets-Data-Analysis

DAY_1: So here I am with my first project of Data Analysis on Exoplanets. Generally we compare things that we already know about, have you ever heard about people who plotted mass against number of moons of that planet and its equilibrium temperature vs mass of a planet or equilibrium temperature vs number of moons of a planet. I you havn't then we are here to show you some amazing thing that you would have never seen. To be frank I dont know whats going to happen, It can be that a new formula will be found or I will just get to see some random stuff that I cant figure out. So lets see what happens.
