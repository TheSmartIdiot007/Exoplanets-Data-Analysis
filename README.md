# Exoplanets-Data-Analysis (Ongoing Project)

- Generally, we compare things that we already know about. Have you ever heard about people who plotted mass against the number of moons of that planet and its equilibrium temperature vs mass of a planet or equilibrium temperature vs the number of moons of a planet? If you haven't, we are here to show you some amazing things you would have never seen. To be frank, I don't know what's going to happen; It can be that new formula will be found, or I will just get to see some random stuff that I can't figure out. So let's see what happens.

- If you want to know what happened in the project then why not open it.
